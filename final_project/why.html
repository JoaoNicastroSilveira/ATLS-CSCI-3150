    <h1>Why Universal Design Matters</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Universal Design matters because the internet is supposed to be for everyone — not just people browsing on a perfect device under perfect conditions. 
      When we design with inclusion in mind from the start, we create digital spaces that feel welcoming, understandable, and usable for more people.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bigger Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Once you start paying attention, you realize how many tiny details can unintentionally block people: low contrast text, confusing layouts, missing labels, 
      sites that only work with a mouse, or content that only makes sense if you already know what you're looking for. 
      Universal Design challenges us to think beyond our own habits and build with real human variety in mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cool part is that inclusive design doesn’t just help people with disabilities — it also benefits anyone who has ever tried to use their phone in bright sunlight, 
      deal with slow Wi-Fi, navigate with one hand, or make sense of a cluttered interface. In other words, it helps all of us.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters Right Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> No one should be locked out of the web because of poor design choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Better usability for everyone:</strong> Clear hierarchy, readable text, and consistent layout improve the experience for all users.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Interfaces that behave in reliable ways reduce confusion and frustration.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical responsibility:</strong> Accessibility is a right — not a bonus feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Future-proofing:</strong> Semantic and accessible code adapts better to new devices and technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Movement Shaping the Web’s Future</h2>
    <p>
      The internet has evolved because people pushed for better standards — like semantic HTML, web accessibility, and cleaner CSS. 
      Universal Design feels like the next big shift. As new designers and developers, our generation has the power to influence how inclusive the web becomes. 
      The more we adopt these practices, the better the digital world becomes for everyone.
