    <h1>What Is Universal Design?</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Universal Design is about creating digital experiences that work for the widest range of people possible. 
      Instead of designing for a “typical” user, we design for real people with real differences — different devices, abilities, environments, and expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>A More Realistic View of Users</h2>
    <p>
      Not everyone uses the web the same way. Some rely on screen readers, some navigate with a keyboard, 
      some zoom their text to 200%, and some browse on older phones with tiny screens. Universal Design embraces that reality. 
      Rather than building separate “accessible versions,” we create one experience flexible enough to support everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>The Seven Principles of Universal Design</h2>
    <p>Here’s my simplified version of the seven principles and why they matter:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> Design that works fairly for everyone without needing special alternatives.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> Support different devices, inputs, and interaction styles.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple & Intuitive:</strong> If someone needs instructions to use your interface, it’s too complicated.</li>
      <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> Content should still make sense even with distractions or limitations.</li>
      <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> Interfaces should be forgiving — mistakes happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Effort:</strong> No tiny tap targets or awkward gestures that require precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Enough Space & Structure:</strong> Make layouts that work across all screen sizes and assistive tech.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UD vs. Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Accessibility is often about meeting requirements. Universal Design is more about the mindset behind those requirements.
      It encourages us to think deeply about how people actually use the web and to design with empathy. 
      When you prioritize Universal Design, accessibility comes naturally.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Future Designers</h2>
    <p>
      Technology will always change, but human needs stay fairly consistent. 
      Universal Design helps us build experiences that adapt gracefully to new devices and new interactions. 
      It’s one of the few approaches that stands the test of time.
